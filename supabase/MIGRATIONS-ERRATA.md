# Migration errata — corrections to files in `supabase/migrations/`

Migrations are append-only once applied (project rule #7): a comment that turns out to be
wrong can never be fixed in place, and the file keeps asserting it to everyone who reads it.

Corrections land here. One section per migration, newest first. Each entry names the lines it
supersedes and points at the test that holds the verified behaviour — the test is the source
of truth, this file is the signpost.

It lives one level up from the migrations it annotates: the Supabase CLI treats every file in
`supabase/migrations/` as a candidate migration and prints a "Skipping …" line for anything
that isn't `<timestamp>_name.sql`.

This is not a changelog. Only add an entry when a comment in an applied migration is
**materially misleading** about what the SQL does.

### L23-26 — the Momenti privacy trade is neither total nor triggered by one field

The product note says a member who marks `identity_tags` private "scores affinity 0 against
everyone and therefore drops out of Momenti matching entirely". Both halves are wrong.

**It takes both tag fields, not one.** Affinity sums three terms (L90-92):

```
shared    = recipient.identity_tags ∩ candidate.identity_tags
seek_hit  = recipient.seeking       ∩ candidate.identity_tags
offer_hit = recipient.identity_tags ∩ candidate.seeking
```

`identity_tags` and `seeking` are masked by **independent** predicates (L95-98). Hiding
`identity_tags` alone empties the first two terms but leaves `offer_hit` live, so the member
keeps matching anyone whose identity tags meet their still-visible `seeking`. Affinity only
reaches 0 when **both** fields are private.

**And it is one-directional.** The masking applies to the **candidate** side only; the
`recipients` CTE reads `p.identity_tags` and `p.seeking` **raw** (L77). A member with both
fields private therefore:

- **does** disappear from everyone else's deck, and
- **still receives** a deck of their own, scored against their own private tags.

All three cases are asserted next to each other in
`supabase/tests/0073_visibility_followups.test.sql`: both-private ⇒ no match, `identity_tags`
alone ⇒ still matched via `offer_hit`, and the recipient direction.

No leak follows from the recipient direction: the derived `reasons` never leave the recipient's
own row (`momento_proposals_select_own`, `20260619222420_m9_blocks_and_not_blocked.sql:108-111`).

### L18-21 — Realtime does filter payload columns by privilege

The header says Realtime "applies row RLS but not column privileges", and presents the
publication column list at L172-174 as the control that closes the hole.

The installed `realtime.apply_rls` **does** filter payload columns by `has_column_privilege`.
The primary control is therefore the column-scoped `grant` in
`20260807170813_m10_profile_visibility_enforcement.sql:66-68`; the publication column list is
defense-in-depth on the same door.

Asserted in `supabase/tests/0073_visibility_followups.test.sql` (the realtime publication
check, with the accurate note beside it).
